##Workflow
Current workflow for project is git-flow, however we are going to change it to github-flow with next release. Please make pull requests to develop branch.
##Start
To start clone repository and open project in Android Studio. You will see three modules: app for child, app for therapists and shared database repository. Run appManager to create schedules and see them by running the app. For that moment we are fixing bugs and making code improvements (by tests and translations), what helps for future usability and functionality improvements. We are also open for suggestions, if you would like to improve something, which is needed but does not have any issue, please make pull request. Try make changes as small as possible and always provide a test for them.
